## Screens

### image board

The main screen shows the image board with the six latest uploads of images, followed by title, an extract of the description and the username of who has added the picture. If there are more images captured in the data base, the visitor can load them via the button below. The input fields on top allow to upload an individual travel experience. Username, title and image are madatory; the description is obligatory. The input fields have a error handeling in case one or more mandatory fields are not filled out. If the upload was successfully a short message pops up to thank for sharing the expierence on the image board.

The pictures on the image board are shown in black and white; by hovering, the cursor will appear with the logo and the picture changes to colors.

In the footer section, the user will find a link to another project I have done within the Spiced Bootcamp.

### components

By clicking on a picture of the image board, an overlay will pop up. It shows all the details about the image (username, title, description, date of uploading). Additionally, there is a possibility to leave a comment below. A back button on top brings the user back to the image board screen; the overlay will disappear.
